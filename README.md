### Analyzing citibike data with tableau

The purpose of this project is to determine the feasability of a Citibike service in Des Moine. We would help measure this with a number of data visualizations we have retrieved from the Citibike service which is currently operating in New York City.

We can see above the varying levels of use different bikes undergo in New York City. Each panel cooresponds to a Citibike. Citibikes with red panels see the heaviest usage, and therefore will need frequent maintenance.

This bar chart shows the peak hours of bike utilization during the month of August. We can use this chart to determine when the best time is to perform maintenance on said bikes. Because the ideal time to perform maintenance would be during of time of low bike use, we can determine that the best time frame would be in the early morning hours somewhere between 2-5 AM.

This line chart displays various trip duration times for all bikes in use in the city. What this shows is that the majority trips taken on citibikes last half an hour or less, with the most trips lasting roughly 8 minutes in length.

Checkout times by gender charts for trip duration times as well but also filters for gender. We can see that a large majority of trips taken come from male subscribers or customers but the trip duration appear to correlate evenly across gender.

This heat map above shows what times citibikes are used most often and on which weekdays. From what we can see the most frequent use occurs during weekdays between 7-9 AM and 5-7 PM, which would be the standard times for people commuting to and from work.

This group of heat maps also measures for hourly utilization for each weekday but also filters for gender like the earlier line chart. From what is shown we can see that despite females having lower utilization of citibikes than males, the pattern of use still remains the same.

Here we can see two maps of citibike stations in the NYC area, with more popular starting/ending stations denoted with larger bubbles. Please note that the most popular stations are located closer to tourist/commuter areas.

Lastly we have an additional heat map displaying bike usage be each weekday and filtered between subscribers and customers as well as gender. We can see from the heat map that male subscribers are by far more frequent users of the Citibike service.

#### Summary

There are several points to be made in conclusion to this analysis. Firstly the citibike service appears to be a product more conducive to larger urban centers. The reason being that a large city may be subject to traffic jams, thereby necessitating alternative modes of transportation such as rental bikes. A large city also would be able to house numerous rental bike stations throughout the city, which would help increase potential revenue due to ease of access. 

If a Citibike service is to be set up in Des Moines, it will need to have numerous stations set throughout its more populated areas. Outside of this you may want to attempt marketing towards a female demographic as it may encourage more females to try the Citibike service.
